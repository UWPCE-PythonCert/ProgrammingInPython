Python Pushups

These are a couple exercises to kick you off with Python

==============

* Create a new directory in your working dir for the class::

  $ mkdir pushups
  $ cd pushups

* Add a new file to it called ``break_me.py``

* In the ``break_me.py`` file write four simple Python functions:

  * Each function, when called, should cause an exception to happen

  * Each function should result in one of the four most common exceptions you'll find.

  * for review:
    - ``NameError``
    - ``TypeError``
    - ``SyntaxError``
    - ``AttributeError``

(hint -- the interpreter will quit when it hits a Exception -- so you can comment out all but the one you are testing at the moment)

  * Use the Python standard library reference on `Built In Exceptions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html>`_ as a reference
