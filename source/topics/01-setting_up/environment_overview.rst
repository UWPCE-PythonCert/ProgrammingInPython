Introduction to your Programming Environment
############################################

This program is a course of instruction in developing with the Python programming language.

Python is a language with multiple implementations, and many different ways to edit and run code.

One's development environment is a personal thing. What is most productive for you depends on what platform you use, how you like to work, what the people you work with are using, etc. It is a very personal choice.

Each of you starting this program comes with a different background and experience. So we do not require that you use a particular development environment. Indeed, each of the instructors in the program uses their own tools and approach.

However, there are some core requirements, and we provide advice for what to do if you are just getting started.

Core Requirements for Python Development
========================================

There are three basic elements to your environment when working with Python for this class:

* A way to run your code, add packages to Python, use git, etc.

  - You really need at least a little familiarity with the command line for this.

* A Python interpreter

  - We use "cPython" version 3.8 or greater for this class.

* A way to edit your code.

  - Any good programmer's text editor with a Python mode will work well.

If you are already set up with all this, then go straight here:

and give it a try.
