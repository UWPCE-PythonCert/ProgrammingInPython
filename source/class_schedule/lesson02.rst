Python Tutorial
...............

Tutorials come in many forms, but I define a python "tutorial" as a quick high-level introduction, designed to kick start your python programming. It should give you enough to get something done, but not provide a lot of detailed explanations.  If you have been doing a bit of python coding already, or have taken an introductory programing class with Python, then you may be able to skip this step.

Every one of you has a different background and learning style. So take a bit of time to figure out which resource works for you.

:ref:`python_learning_resources`

Provides some options. Do look it over.

Python Basics
-------------

If you are comfortable with the materials in a tutorial, it's time for some more in-depth discussion. Here are a few options to get you started this week:

Finish Reading: :ref:`basic_python_syntax`

Read: :ref:`more_on_functions`

Read: :ref:`documentation`


Supplemental Reading
--------------------

If that is too fast, then here are some good options for another look:

*Think Python:* Chapters 1–6 (http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)

*Dive Into Python:* Chapters 1–2 (http://www.diveintopython3.net/)

*LPTHW:* ex. 1–10, 18-21 (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

(note: LPTHW used to be totally free --now it looks like you may only get a sneak peak -- darn! -- but the first few "chapters" are available)

**GOAL**

You should be comfortable with working with variables, numbers, strings, and basic functions before the next class.

git
---

We are only using a small subset of git functionality for this class,
but if you feel lost, and/or want to know more, these are some good resources:
