Programming in Python
#####################

This site holds many of the materials for the
`University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education Python Certificate <https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming>`_
`Introductory class <https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/programming-in-python>`_

This site can be thought of as the textbook for Programming in Python: the first course in the program. It contains notes about the topics covered in the classes, programming exercises, supplemental materials about setting up a development environment, and assorted references about Python-related topics.

Many of these topics can be useful on their own, but each assumes that you know concepts that were introduced earlier in the program, so working through them in order can be helpful.
