Puzzles
=======

To get a bit of exercise solving some puzzles with Python, work on the Python
exercises at "Coding Bat": http://codingbat.com/python

There are 8 sets of puzzles. Do as many as you can, but make sure to do at least three -- and all the "Warmups" would be a good goal.

While the CodingBat site has an interface for submitting your solution and see if it works, we suggest you write your code in your regular text editor and get it to run on your machine first.

If you are in a formal class, let the instructor know which ones you have done.

Remember this site -- it's a good idea to come back and play again with these little puzzles as you learn more Python. It's kind of like playing scales to keep fresh when learning a musical instrument.
